This is for The Odin Project Recipes Assignmen

This content I am currently adding now is being done through VIM on my terminal.I will be contruscting a website using HTML that will include the previous assignment's work I have done in my "MyTheOdinProjectWork" repo. This is a brief explanation of that. I will also be git commiting the same way as I have been. For now at least until I fully grasp the 7 rules of a great Git commit message which will be soon. 

Thanks,
Jimmie
